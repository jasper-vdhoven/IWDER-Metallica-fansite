# IWDER-Metallica-fansite
A fansite created for the metal band Metallica for the HSL IWDER project.

## Goal of the project

The code in this repository was created for the Hogeschool Leiden (HSL) subject IWDER in which the student is supposed to create a fansite for a music group, TV show or movie.
I decided to create mine about the metal band Metallica.

## Code restrictions

The code in this repository contains many hacks and tries to follow the MDN documentation where possible. Further restrictions opposed onto the project was that no boilerplate or frameworks were allowed to be used. This left the code to be pure handwritten JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The code in this repository further tries to negate the need for JS where possible in favour for faster loading and less hacks with JS code.
